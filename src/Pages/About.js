          <p>
            Welcome to Byters - Pakistan's trusted food review app, created by
            university students who are always on the lookout for new dining
            experiences and honest reviews. We understand the struggle of
            finding reliable opinions on local food spotsâ€”often, reviews are
            scattered across Google, Instagram, or other platforms, with mixed
            feedback that don't always tell the full story. Byters was built to
            simplify this process, providing a single platform dedicated to food
            reviews from Pakistan's diverse culinary scene.

            Our Inspiration
          </h1>
          <p>
            Our journey began with a common experience: trying to decide if an
            Italian buffet in Lahore was worth the hype. Some reviews said it
            was a must-try, while others called it bland and overpriced. This
            led us to ask, "What if there was a platform just for food reviews
            in Pakistan, where you could easily find trusted opinions?" With
            Byters, we aim to make food discovery transparent, accessible, and
            community-driven.
